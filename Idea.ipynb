    "\n",
    "According to the initial purpose and audience of this project, skilled worker visa types (skilled worker visa and skilled worker visa - Health & Care) are the fixed visa type subgroup. Users will need to use other filters(year/quarter, visa type, nationality, region, occupation, industry, SOC code, Occ. major group, Occ. sub-major group, Occ. minor group, Occ. unit group) from list of fields to search for the number of applications or grants.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make a difference from the existing exel file provided by Home Office. The page would be easy to use with users who want to search information base on their occupations and who want to see in a wider view using Occ. group\n",
